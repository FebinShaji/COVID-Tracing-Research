# COVID-Tracing-Research

The purpose of this project is to work together as a group to investigate the challenges present in computing for a given scenario.

Scenario
There is an urgent need for coronavirus contact-tracing applications in all countries in
the world. In the UK, the Government tested one solution [1] on the Isle of White in
May [2] and abandoned it in favour of a solution that would link to Google and Apple in
June [3] and have spent an estimated £35m so far [4] with the new app launched on
September 24th (www.covid19.nhs.uk ) with fears about its uptake. Other countries
have done better (or worse) but effective contact tracing is hugely important for
tackling the pandemic and we need to learn the lessons quickly if Computer Science is to
help in the future

In this assignment you are asked to investigate the development of contact tracing apps
in two countries.

You might choose to look at:
- Stakeholder Analysis of the key stakeholders and their “stake” in the solution
- Functional and non-functional requirements for the solution
- Technical opportunities with modern smartphones and constraints with old ones
- Use cases or user stories
- Logical design diagram
- Technical Architecture diagram
- Data model (showing what data is held centrally and on citizen’s phones)
- Security Threat analysis – what would hackers be interested in and why
- Usability assessment
- SWOT (Strengths, Weakness, Threats and Opportunities) analysis
- Timeline of development (including design decisions and mistakes)
- Political, ethical, sociological, technological, legal and environmental issues
- Anything else you feel is relevant or helpful
